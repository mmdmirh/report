\subsection{Data Processing pipeline}
Underlying these visual interfaces is a robust data processing pipeline. Figure \ref{fig:script_response} visualizes the raw JSON outputs generated by the FormScript engine. These structured responses confirm that the system correctly translates raw pose landmarks into semantic "Super FormCodes" (e.g., \texttt{GOOD\_REP}, \texttt{ELBOW\_DRIFT}), which then drive both the AR arrows and the AI coaching.
