\subsubsection{Real-Time Visual Feedback}
The primary contribution of FitCoachAR is the low-latency Augmented Reality overlay. Figure \ref{fig:ar_arrows} demonstrates the system's ability to detect form errors in real-time. In this example (Bicep Curl), the system detected "Elbow Drift" and immediately rendered a directional arrow guiding the user to tuck their elbow in. This visual cue is generated within 100ms, providing instant correction without interrupting the exercise flow.
