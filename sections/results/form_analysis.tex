\subsection{Quantitative Form Analysis}
After completing a set, the system compiles a detailed "Form Analysis" report. Figure \ref{fig:form_analysis} shows the post-set summary screen. The system aggregates data from all repetitions to calculate an overall "Form Score" (e.g., 90\%). It also provides a breakdown of specific issues, such as "Body Swing" or "Incomplete Range," along with a rep-by-rep analysis. This allows users to identify consistent patterns in their technique.
