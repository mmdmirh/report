\subsection{Generative AI Coaching}
To provide deeper insights, FitCoachAR integrates a Large Language Model (LLM) as a virtual coach. Figure \ref{fig:ai_coach} shows the chat interface where the user can ask questions about their performance. The LLM receives the structured workout data (FormCodes) and provides natural language advice. In this instance, the coach offers specific tips on how to fix the "Body Swing" issue detected during the set.
