\subsection{Online Repetition Segmentation}
Following AIFit's unsupervised approach, motion periodicity is analyzed from key joint angles (elbow, knee, hip). A simplified online state machine detects phase transitions—descent, bottom, ascent—using derivative sign changes with hysteresis. Each full cycle is labeled as one repetition.
