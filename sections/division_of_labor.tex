\section{Division of Labor}
\label{sec:division-of-labor}

This project was completed as a group effort. Below we summarize the workload division.

\paragraph{Yangyang Zhang.}
Yangyang's primary responsibilities include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Establishing the core frontend--backend streaming pipeline (e.g., WebSocket-based frame delivery and latency reduction), along with primary front-end UI design and the initial AR overlay/markers.
    \item Empirical model analysis and experiments reported in Sec.~4.1, covering multi-backend benchmarking, stability evaluation, and latency measurement.
    \item Design and proposal of the four lightweight post-processing techniques for stabilizing MoveNet~2D outputs.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Other team members.}
Please fill in the corresponding responsibilities for the remaining members (e.g., backend services, calibration logic, repetition segmentation, LLM feedback, and report writing) to keep the report self-contained.
