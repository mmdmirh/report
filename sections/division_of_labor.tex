\section{Division of Labor}
\label{sec:division-of-labor}

This project was completed as a group effort. Below we summarize the workload division.

\paragraph{Yangyang Zhang.}
Yangyang's primary responsibilities include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Establishing the core frontend--backend streaming pipeline (e.g., WebSocket-based frame delivery and latency reduction), along with primary front-end UI design and the initial AR overlay/markers.
    \item Design and proposal of the four lightweight post-processing techniques (reported in Sec.~\ref{sec:model-eval}) for stabilizing MoveNet~2D outputs.
    \item Empirical model analysis and experiments reported in Sec.~\ref{sec:movenet-postproc}, covering multi-backend benchmarking, stability evaluation, and latency measurement.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Seyedmohamad Mirhoseininejad.}
Seyedmohamad's primary responsibilities include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design and implementation of the FormScript feedback system, including elementary FormCodes and Super FormCodes for rule-based form analysis.
    \item Development of the calibration system for personalized range-of-motion thresholds.
    \item Integration of LLM-powered post-workout summaries using Llama 3.3 70B via Cerebras, including per-rep feedback aggregation.
    \item FormCode validation experiments on the RepCount dataset (Sec.~4.6).
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Maximilian Fuchs.}
Please fill in the corresponding responsibilities for the remaining members (e.g., backend services, calibration logic, repetition segmentation, LLM feedback, and report writing) to keep the report self-contained.
