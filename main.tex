\begin{abstract}
We present \textbf{FitCoachAR}, a real-time adaptive exercise coaching system that combines lightweight pose estimation with augmented-reality feedback and LLM-powered coaching.
The system addresses key limitations of existing fitness applications: lack of real-time corrective feedback, sensitivity to viewpoint changes, and shallow semantic analysis.
Our contributions are threefold.
First, we benchmark multiple pose estimation backends and propose a four-step post-processing pipeline (body-centric canonicalization, yaw compensation, adaptive temporal smoothing, and anatomical consistency projection) that substantially improves joint-angle accuracy and cross-view stability without increasing inference latency.
Second, we introduce \textbf{FormScript}, a semantic intermediate representation that transforms raw pose measurements into interpretable \emph{FormCodes}, which are discrete biomechanical descriptors enabling rule-based form analysis and exercise-specific reasoning.
A short calibration phase personalizes range-of-motion thresholds to each user.
These FormCodes drive both real-time AR-based corrective feedback and \textbf{LLM-powered post-workout summaries} (Llama 3.3 70B via Cerebras), which synthesize per-rep feedback into personalized coaching recommendations.
Third, we validate the FormCode system on the RepCount dataset (101 squat videos, 969 repetitions), achieving biomechanically plausible classifications through data-driven threshold optimization.
Together, these components enable stable, interpretable, and interactive exercise coaching on consumer-grade hardware.
